# üõ°Ô∏è M4N: Honeypot OS + SIEM Fusion

**M4N** is a lightweight, purpose-built honeypot operating system designed to attract, log, and analyze malicious activity ‚Äî acting as both a trap and a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system.

---

## üîç What It Does

- üéØ **Attracts attackers** with emulated services and vulnerable-looking endpoints
- üì¶ **Captures logs** from network traffic, system calls, and unauthorized access attempts
- üß† **Analyzes behavior** to identify patterns, indicators of compromise (IOCs), and attack vectors
- üìä **Feeds data** into SIEM pipelines for deeper threat intelligence and response

---

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- **Languages**: C, Assembly, Python
- **Core Components**:
  - `src/`: Honeypot logic and system emulation
  - `scripts/`: Automation and deployment tools
  - `build_scripts/`: Build automation and packaging
  - `tools/fat/`: FAT filesystem tools and utilities
- **Build System**: SCons
- **Dependencies**: See `requirements.txt`
